## Objective: <br/>
This game is aimed to help prospective physics students by exposing them to the physics concept of projectile motions. This game will allow students to visualise projectile motions with different initial velocities and angles. Students can therefore try to apply the physics concepts learnt in this game and get them more interested in studying physics. 

## Description: <br/>
This game starts with the system telling the user the distance between the cannon and the target. From there, it prompts the user to input the velocity and angle required to fire the cannon to the target. Thereafter, stars are awarded to the user depending on how close the cannon ball's trajectory is to the target. The closer the trajectory path of the cannonball, the more stars are awarded. It is required for this game to use the Turtle, random and math library. <br/>
